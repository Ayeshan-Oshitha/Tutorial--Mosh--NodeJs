# Introducing MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL / Document Database.

In SQL databases, we should design databases ahead of time (create schemas). But in MongoDB, we don't need to do that — we can simply store JSON objects in the database.

In MongoDB, it simply returns the JSON object, so we can transfer it — no conversion needed.
