**Node Package Manager** (NPM) is a command-line tool as well as a registry(online database) of 3rd party libraries we can add to our applications.

We can see those packages on the npmjs website. We can install Node modules via a command-line tool also called npm (Node Package Manager).

Why NPM is considered as a CLI as well as registry ?

- The **tool you use locally** to manage packages (the CLI) (_npm install, npm update_)
- The **online service** that hosts the packages (the registry).

# Package.json

The **package.json** file is a basic file that contains information about the project. It is basically a bunch of metadata.

All Node.js applications have this package.json file. To create a package.json file, we can use the command `npm init`.

Also, if we want to create a package.json file without answering all the questions, we can use `npm init --yes`.
