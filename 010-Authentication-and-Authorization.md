# Introduction

**Authentication** - The process of verifying the identity of a user to confirm they are who they claim to be

**Authorization** - The process of determining whether a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action

- Register: POST /api/users

- Login: POST /api/users - Sometimes, the operation we're dealing with doesn't follow the typical Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) semantics. In RESTful terms, we model such operations as requests or commands â€” for example, a login request or login command.

  - **Command** - emphasizes the intent to perform an action.

  - **Request** - Refers to a custom operation that doesn't map to a standard REST resource.

# Registering User

findById(id) - Used to find a document by its \_id field only

findOne(filter) - Used to find a document matching any condition(s)

# Using Loash

When returning data, we **should not return the password**. We can simply return the object without the password, and that is okay.

```javascript
res.send({
    _id:result._id
    name:result.name,
    email:result.email
});

```

But to do this more efficiently, we can use an external library called **`Lodash`**.

Lodash provides a lot of utility functions to work with objects, numbers, arrays, and strings. It is an optimized version of the Underscore package.

Also, if we want to enforce password complexity (like requiring lowercase, uppercase letters, numbers, etc.), we can use the npm package **`joi-password-complexity`**, which is built on top of Joi.
